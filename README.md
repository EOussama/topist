## Description
A welcoming platform for all of those professional and silly TOP X lists. Naaah, don't mind that, it's just another desperate attempt to make this mini project look cool, but fancy words can sometimes be unrealistic and very unforgiving.
Topist (in case it hasn't hit the bell yet “Top list(s)”) is a minimalistic chunk of javascript code trying its best to do a decent job in the back end side of things (try saying that a few years ago and hope nobody chases you like an urban werewolf). I guess all of that was in the past, NodeJS has made a big change, and there I go again drifting away from my main point, I might as well rename this to some history lecture and call it a day.
